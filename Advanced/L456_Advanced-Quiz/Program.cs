Question 1:
BMI Calculation

The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is calculated based on the following formula: 
BMI = weight / (height x height)

Note:
- weight is in kilograms (e.g. 65.0)
- height is in metres (e.g. 1.70)

Write a C# program to:
- prompt the user to enter his/her weight and height
- calculate the BMI (body mass index)
- display the BMI and the health category according to the table below:

BMI Health category
Below 18.5    Underweight
18.5 - 23     Normal weight
23 - 27.5     Overweight
Above 27.5    Obese

Question 2:
Discount Calculation [using if..else]

The discount rate given by a shopping mall is shown below:
----------------------------------------------
| Amount spent ($)      |  Discount Rate (%) |
| 100 and below         |        0           |
| 100 < amount <= 500   |        5           |
| 500 < amount <= 1000  |       10           |
| Above 1000            |       20           |
----------------------------------------------
Write a C# program to:
- prompt the user to enter the amount spent 
- calculate and display the discount given (in percentage)
- calculate and display the discount amount

/*
Question 3:
Multiplication Table [using repetition structure]

Write a C# program to display the multiplication table for a given number from 1 to 12.

Example:
Enter a number : 8
1  8
2  16
3  24
4  32
5  40
6  48
7  56
8  64
9  72
10 80
11 88
12 96
*/




/*
Question 4:
Admin Menu [using methods, loop & nested if]

Write a C# program that displays the main menu and allows the user to select options to perform BMI calculation, discount calculation, or display a multiplication table. The program should repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

Example:
------------- MENU --------------
[1] Calculate Body Mass Index
[2] Calculate Discount
[3] Display Multiplication Table
[0] Exit
---------------------------------

/*
Question 5:
Write a program that adds up to 5 unique words to a list. 
The user can enter ‘x’ to stop adding words. 
Once either 5 words are added or the user stops the program early, 
the words are listed and the total number of letters in the words are displayed.

Example:
Enter a word (or 'x' to stop): apple
Enter a word (or 'x' to stop): banana
Enter a word (or 'x' to stop): orange
Enter a word (or 'x' to stop): x

List of words:
- apple
- banana
- orange

Total number of letters: 16

/*
Question 6:
Write a program that simulates a number guessing game. 
It first generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
It then prompts the user to guess the correct number. 
The user can enter -1 to end the game, or the game will end after 5 tries.


Example:
Guess the number (between 1 and 100, or enter -1 to quit): 50
Too high!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100, or enter -1 to quit): 25
Too low!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100, or enter -1 to quit): 37
Too high!
Guess the number (between 1 and 100, or enter -1 to quit): 30
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 4 tries.

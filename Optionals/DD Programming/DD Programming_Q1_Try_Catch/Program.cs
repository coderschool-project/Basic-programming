//Example of Try-Catch Block:

//try
//{
//    // Code that might throw an exception
//}
//catch (ExceptionType1 ex)
//{
//    // Code to handle ExceptionType1
//}
//catch (ExceptionType2 ex)
//{
//    // Code to handle ExceptionType2
//}
//finally
//{
//    // Code that always runs, regardless of exceptions
//}




// Question 1
// Write a C# program that attempts to divide two numbers and prints any exceptions that may occur.
// Hint: Use a try block to perform the division and a catch block to print any exceptions.
// Test Data: Dividing 10 by 0

// Question 2
// Create a program that converts a string to an integer and prints any exceptions that may occur.
// Hint: Use a try block to convert the string to an integer and a catch block to print any exceptions.
// Test Data: Converting 'abc' to an integer

// Question 3
// Write a C# program that opens a file and prints any exceptions that may occur.
// Hint: Use a try block to open the file and a catch block to print any exceptions.
// Test Data: Opening a non-existent file

// Question 4
// Create a program that reads input from the user and prints any exceptions that may occur.
// Hint: Use a try block to read input from the user and a catch block to print any exceptions.
// Test Data: Reading input from the user

// Question 5
// Write a C# program that performs a calculation and prints any exceptions that may occur.
// Hint: Use a try block to perform the calculation and a catch block to print any exceptions.
// Test Data: Performing a calculation with invalid operands
